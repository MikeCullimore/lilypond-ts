# lilypond-ts

Lilypond scripts in TypeScript. Goal: generate piano scale sheet music images.

## todo

Make changes to `src/index.ts` then run with `npm run start`.

* Generate Lilypond scripts given scale parameters.
    * Adapt from existing code in [sight-reading-ui](https://github.com/MikeCullimore/sight-reading-ui).
    * Merge those two repos? The UI app accepts images generated by this repo.
* Add installation steps to readme (need Lilypond!).
* Add fingering (how to automate?). F major the exception?
* Import common by absolute path or inject directly?
* Generate following scales:
    * ABRSM grade two:
        * Two octaves, hands together:
            * G, F major; A, D minors all variants
        * Two octaves, hands separately:
            * D, A majors; E, G, minors all variants
        * C major contrary motion two octaves hands starting on tonic.
        * Chromatic scale starting on D one octave hands separately.
        * Arpeggios D, A majors, E, G minors, two octaves, hands separately.
* Inject scale-specific config into common template: use Scheme directly?
